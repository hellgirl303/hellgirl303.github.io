                <h3>Description Of my experiance:</h3>
                <p>I almost killed someone! I loved the way that they explained everything.It was fun.
                    However, I am very clumsy and had to do my work more then once which was a pain. But everyone was very optimistic and welcoming.
                    I lover the experiance overall, and will want to go to Chicktech events more and more if this type of thing continues.</p>            </div>
